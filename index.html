    I don't know about programming, so I enrolled in Introduction to programming.<br>
    This is my project 'stage 0'. but I think the body's font is too large.<br>
    I am sad, I don't know how to make small them.<br>
    If you have the solution, plz give me a <a href="mailto:kw8799@gmail.com">email</a>.<br>
    <b>I want all your thinkings and interestings especially in <em>programming.</em></b><br>
    <p>Hope your luck!</p>
